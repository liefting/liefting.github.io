# Bonnie Liefting
Awesome that you found my first attempt at creating my personal website. In the future I might show off some of my projects here, such as apps, sewing projects and poetry. But for now you can enjoy reading about me and have a look at some of my research projects.

## About me
My spare time activities include, but are not limited to, [unicycling](https://uniridersodense.dk/), gardening, sewing, programming, painting and learning to play guitar/mandolin. I'm interested in science outreach, degrowth, [solarpunk](https://www.e-flux.com/architecture/positions/191258/is-ornamenting-solar-panels-a-crime/) and everything open (as in open source, open science, open education, open library, open access, etc.). I also enjoy reading, boardgames, learning new languages,  and last but definitely not least, spending time with my husband, children, family and friends.

## Research
Until November 2024 I worked as a Research Assistant on the project [Dynamic network modelling of depression: towards personalised treatment targets](https://lundbeckfonden.com/en/dynamic-network-modelling-of-depression-towards-personalised-treatment-targets) with [Maria Semkovska](https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/da/persons/maria-semkovska) at the [Department of Psychology](https://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/institutter_centre/institut_psykologi) at the University of Southern Denmark.

I defended my Phd in January 2024 at the Centre for Systems, Dynamics, and Control ([CSDC](https://mathematics.exeter.ac.uk/research/csdc/)) at the University of Exeter (in England). My PhD project was supervised by [Christian Bick](https://www.math.vu.nl/~bick/) and [Kyle Wedgwood](https://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/kcaw201/index.html) and is entitled [Designing the Dynamics of Coupled Oscillators](https://liefting.github.io/2024/01/24/Designing-the-Dynamics-of-Coupled-Oscillators.html).  

During the last year of my PhD I was a visiting researcher at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science ([IMADA](https://imada.sdu.dk/)) at the University of Southern Denmark 
with [Kristian Debrabant](https://imada.sdu.dk/u/debrabant/index_en.php).
